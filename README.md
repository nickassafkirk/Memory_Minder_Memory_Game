## Overview
Memory minder is a fun, interactive brain-training game designed for adults and children*. The game's purpose is to test the users memory, reaction-speed and recall while providing an enjoyable experience during gameplay.
To complete the game, the user must match all the tile pairs, in as few moves as possible and as quickly as they can. This game is a great excercise to challenge a user's short-term memory and reaction speeds and is the perfect activity for 
coffee breaks, keeping children entertained or killing some time while travelling on public transport. 

*while this game is perfectly suitable for children over 6. Parental supervision is recommended with user children, to ensure icons are appropriate for
younger users.

**NB** This project is for educational purposes only. All media utilised for this project is for educational use only.

## UX

With regards to the layout and structure of this project, a minimal design was intentionally chosen to encourage users to navigate to the sites main point of interest: the Game area.  
The addition of vibrant colors and a large range of interesting icons, themes and strong visual queues were chosen to offset the minimal design and provide a fun, casual
asthetic. Fonts with a "doodly", handwritten nature, bright primary colors and page layouts that are not dissimilar to copy books from 
school were chosen to fit a motif that reminds users of childhood and the enjoyment of distraction and simple childhood games.
Javascript was used extensively to generate a suite of strong user feedback methods, to engage game users, prevent user error
and encourage first time learning.

## Skeleton

### Navigation

There are limited navigation elements provided on this site. This is intentional and has been designed to encourage users to remain on the game play page
where they can continue game play.

Navigation elements include:
1. #### Logo 
 - A consistent logo present on each site page, links to site homepage to allow convenient access to index.html page and to encourage familiar first-time learning.
2. #### Main Navigation Bar:
 - A consistent top nav bar menu is present at the top of each page to allow navigation to the 3 key site pages from each individual webpage. 
 - The navbar utilizes Bootstrap's navbar collapse component to create a navbar which is compressed on smaller screen sizes to maximise available space for the gameplay area.
 - A **"Menu"** heading and berger stack icon is used to facilitate first-time learning of the collapsed navbar's purpose.

3. #### Pseudo-Buttons/Links:
- while `<button>` elements are exclusively used as gameplay controls as opposed to navigation elements, there are two applications where button-like objects are used for the purpose of navigation. 
 1. A link styled as a button is present on the leaderboard.html page if no scores have been retrieved from localStorage. While this is
 actually an anchor element styled with bootstrap's `.btn` class, it's purpose is the quickly transport new users to the index.html page, where they 
 can play the game and register scores.
 1. On the index.html a `div` element is styled in a button-like fashion to provide access to the game settings dropdown menu. While this does not navigate to a 
 new page, it provides access to a specific page section and as such has been considered a navgation feature.

## Surface

The surface of this game is intended to present a fun and friendly experience for a broad-range of users. The design has been 
kept simple to keep attention on gameplay area; the sites primary focus. 
The fonts, colors and other styles have been chosen to produce an emotive child-like experience with the use of playful arts & crafts themed fonts and broad color palette dominated by vibrant primary colors.

### Fonts
Two fonts have been chosen for this project. 

1. [Finger Paint](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Finger+Paint?preview.text_type=custom)
- This playful font has a playful hand drawn style, that fits the intended "childhood" motif I was trying to achieve. 
- The finger paint font is the primary font utilised sitewide.
- This font is for the Logo, main navigation, headings, button text, labels and in the leaderboard table. During testing it was
found to be adequately legible by multiple users. 
- In areas with larger passages of text, a different font has been chosen to improved readability.
2. [Patrick Hand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand?preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles)
- This font was chosen to fit with the playful, light-hearted and juvenile that is aimed for this project. However this font was chosen to compliment
the Finger Paint font while improving readability of larger passages of text. 
- For this reason the Patrick hand font has been chosen for the section body sections of the rules.html page.
- Initially the [Patrick Hand SC](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patrick+Hand+SC?preview.text_type=custom) font was selected and though this font was preferred stylistically, during testing it was found to be difficult to 
read multi-line blocks of text because of it's uppercase style.
---

### Colors      
Colors are used to increase contrast, visual impact and to improve readability across the site. Colors are used during game play to faciliatate matching of tile pairs and reinforce the concept that tiles exist in matching pairs. 
The sites chosen color palette is dominated by primary colors
Root variables are used to allow quick stylisitic changes to be made and to facilitate future color changes if necessary. The main colors used on this project are as follows:

### Icons

#### Primary icons
Primary icons utilised for this project were sourced from [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/).
The selection of gathered for this project were designed to appeal to a broad range of users and to be appropriate for a wide-range of users. 
Icons which adhered to a specific theme/subject matter were used to create the different gameplay themes.
- Random: The random theme utilises an array of icons with no specific subject matter. Thes were chosen as the default theme to communciate the
random nature of each game. 
- Animals: The animals theme comprises of an array of animal icons. It was curated to appeal to a broad-audience because most people love animals.
- Explore: The explore theme is a collection of icons which have are related to the great outdoors and adventure. This them was chosen to appeal to the many people who are
craving some outdoor adventure having been deprived of the ability to travel in the current global climate.

Icons are also utilised as metaphors to reinforce meaning and encourage first-time-learning of key site components. 
for example: 
- The burger stack icon is used to denote the menus expandeable nature on smaller screen sizes. 
- The down caret arrow is used to indicate that the game settings bar is also expandable.
- The Trophy Icon is used as a metaphor to reinforce that the topscore is the best score in the game completion scoreboard.


#### Other Icons    
- The tick and cross Icons used to highlight correct and incorrect matches during gameplay. 
These two icons were sourced from [toptal.com](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/) and were chosen so they could be used
as values for `content` css property in the style.css stylesheet.
---

### Images 
- The lightbulb head image used in the Header Logo is the only image utilised in this project. It was chosen because It's a metaphor for bright-ideas
which I thought was particularly relevant to a brain-training game. It also has a quirky, random nature which is compliments and adds to the 
general quirky style of the project.

---

### Animations

Animations are used to highlight the interative/clickable nature of key site navigation elements and to provide dynamic user feedback during gameplay.

1. A css wiggle animation is utilised to create an interactive animation when a user hovers their cursor over the main navigation items.
This animation is achieved using pure css but is called using the javascript mouseover/mouseoff event listeners

1. Javascript timeouts are used to create animation-like event which highlights correct and incorrect match attempts by quickly adding a green mask and tick icon to correct
matches and and transparent red mask to incorrect matches. These animations are used to promote first time learning by teaching new users the behaviour when correct and 
incorrect matches are made.

---

## Testing

The current deployed version of this project has been thoroughly tested to ensure a great user experience on most common device types.
Testing has also confirmed compatibility with all common browsers to accommodate a great user experience and predictable functionality 
for as many users as possible. 

The responsive functionality of the site has been tested to work on most common devices with a 320px screen-width and larger. 

### Validation

#### HTML5

All HTML pages in this deployed project successfully passed validation without returning any error or warnings. 
HTML files were validated using W3C's [Nu HTML Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
when files were initally passed through the validator an error was returned due to a # sign being accidentally included in the `aria-controls="#navbarCollapse"` property in the navbar. 
The # was subsequently removed and all HTML code passed validation without any errors or warnings.

#### CSS3    
The style.css file used to add custom styling to this project was validated using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)
The CSS passed validation with 0 errors. 
14 warnings were returned:
One warning was returned because of imported fonts which are not checked when validating by direct input.
The other 13 warnings were due to the use of root variables, which can be ignored as root variables are currently not supported by this validator.  
When the style.css file was validated no errors were recorder but 35 warnings were returned. The additional 20 warnings were in relation to vendor prefixes which
are currently not supportede by the W3C css validation service.

![valid css](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue)

#### Javascript

All javascript code was validated using [jshint](https://jshint.com/)
During the first validation attempt of the game.js file a number of missing semi colons and undeclared variables were identified and fixed. 
After which only one warning remined One warning: 
- "Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression." Despite various efforts it was not possible to achieve the required game functionality without this warning. 
the scoreboard.js file and allpages.js files passed validation with no errors or warnings.

## Code 

### Bugs

#### Multiple timer starts possible in single game bug
**Bug:** If start Game button is clicked when timer is already running, The timer speeds up and the end game button no longer stops the game.
**Desired Behaviour:** Timer will start once when game is started and will stop when game is completed or when time is elapsed.
**Fix:** clearInterval(timer) when the startTimer function is called before doing anything else. This resets the timer each time the timer is run
**credit:** solution was found at this [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31036619/timer-goes-twice-as-fast-when-triggered-again/31036796)
`function startTimer() {
    clearInterval(Timer);
    Timer = setInterval(myTimer, 100); 
}`

#### Game tiles active before game has started bug
**Bug:** User could click on tiles before pressing the startGame button. This enabled to get a head start by matching tiles before the timer had started. 
**Desired Behaviour:** Game tiles are only clickable once game has started to prevent cheating. 
**Fix:** The click event listeners on each game tile are only initiated when the game has been started by clicking the startGame button.

#### Game control buttons not formatting correctly bug
**Bug:** When ***"End Game"*** button was clicked, the ***"New Game"*** button was not not displaying as equal height top the end button.   
**Fix:** Template literal was used to insert a <br> element to be displayed on small screensizes. This <br> element was accidentally removed when the innerText
of the button was changed on button click.

![button sizing bug screenshot](assets/images/button-alignment-bug.png)

#### Improper score calculation bug
**Bug:** An extra value was being added to the moves score output box upon game completion. 
**Desired Behaviour:** The number of moves should equal the number of guesses. Each move is considered as two clicks of different tiles. 
**Fix:** the countClicks() function was being called by the calculateScore() function upon game completion as a result an
extra increment was being added to the moves counter when the game was completed. To fix this the calculation was changed to use the clicks value which is returned by the 
countClicks() function so that the moves box does not display the incorrect answer on game completion.

#### Retain ability to change background color of correct matches bug
**Bug:** Re-clicking a correctly matched tile changed it's background-color. While this did not affect the functionality of the game( ie it did not register as a click, move or affect the scoring etc...)
it was deemed confusing, as user may interpret a change of color as a sign that this tile is still available for use. 
**Desired behaviour:** Correctly matched tile pairs should have matching background colors and should have all event listeners removed to prevent any further involvement in the game or
additional style changes.
**Source of Bug*:* The issue was found to be due to a click event listener that is was applied within the setTiles function (shown below), This click event listener calls an anonymous function which assigns a matching background color to each pair of tiles, to be revealed  when each tile is clicked and revealed. 
As the event listener calls an anonymous function, it was not possible to then remove this event listener when the tile was matched correctly. Extracting this functionality out to a function declared at global scope was not possible because the function requires a parameter to be passed that would then be uinnacessible at global scope.
Using the e.target method was also not suitable because again the necessary parameter could not be passed to the function.         
    
`function assignTileInner(tileThemeArray, bgColors, num) {
        tile.innerHTML = tileThemeArray[num];
        tile.setAttribute("icon", tileThemeArray[num])
        tile.addEventListener("click", function(){
            this.style.backgroundColor = bgColors[num];
        })**
      }`

**Fix** The pointer-events css property was applied to each correctly matched tile pairs in the setCorrectMatch function.

`document.getElementById(tileIds[count]).style.pointerEvents = "none";`

While this is not an ideal fix and ideally unneccessary event listeners should be removed, it works as intended and has not been shown 
to cause any issues in testing. An alternative method would be to clone the element to which the event listener is applied and then replace the cloned element with the clone.
This would also remove all event listeners and is documented in [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9251837/how-to-remove-all-listeners-in-an-element)

#### Game settings card-body visible during gameplay bug
**Bug:** If game settings have been changed, the game settings dropdown menu would remain displayed, despite the game settings label being hidden. 

![game settings bug screenshot](assets/images/game-settings-bug.png)    

**Desired Behaviour:** Game settings label and dropdown menu should be hidden to prevent user error during game play.
**Source of bug:** The bootstrap `.show` class was applied to the `<div id="game-settings">...</div>` element which caused this div element to remain visible when the game was in play.
**Bug Fix:** The `.show` class is removed when a new game commences by using the following code `gameSettingsBodyRef.classList.remove("show");` .

#### Super fast tile clicking breaks game bug
**Bug:** When clicking tiles at random and extemely fast, it was possible to cause incorrectly matched tiles to remain displayed and unclickable. 
This prevented game completion because all tile pairs could not be matched. 
**Source of bug:** Timeouts are included within the checkMatch function to highlight incorrect or correct matches in order to provide user feedback. 
Resetting each tile's value takes place within the 500 millisecond timeout, so users can quickly see the value of the second tile they have clicked before it's icon is hidden again, in the case of
an incorrect match. However if a user clicked tiles extremely fast, it was possible to reclick a tile before it's value had been reset. This then registrered the value of the click as `null` 
which consequently meant that the checkMatch function would then be checking for match against a `null` value which effectively broke the game.
**Fix:** An if statement was added to prevent `null` or `undefined` values being tested by the checkMatch function.

`if (tileIcon != null && tileIcon != undefined && tileId != null && tileId != undefined){
        tileIcons.push(tileIcon);
        document.getElementById(tileId).removeEventListener("click", displayTile);
        tileIds.push(tileId);
    }
`
This prevented the described bug and also ensured that these dead clicks were not counted towards the game moves calculation.
After implementing this fix, the game functioned as anticipated.

### Code Credits

#### Prevent Timer being started more than Once
- If the timer was started more than once, it's speed would double causing inaccurate score calculation and a poor user experience.
- A solution was found at this [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31036619/timer-goes-twice-as-fast-when-triggered-again/31036796) which simply cleared the timer interval each time the
timer started to reset it and prevent this bug. 
- code: 
`function startTimer() {
    clearInterval(Timer);
    Timer = setInterval(myTimer, 100); 
}`

#### Pointer Events
- The `pointer-events: "none"` css property was used to prevent additional click events on correectly matched game tiles.
- Information regarding pointer-events was found at these links: 
  1. [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events)
  1. [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/pointer-events/)

#### IsNumber function 
- A small code snippet to check if a value is a number was utilised from [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20169217/how-to-write-isnumber-in-javascript)

- `var isNumber = function isNumber(value) 
{
   return typeof value === 'number' && isFinite(value);
}
`

#### CSS vmin/vmax
- To create a responsive gameboard, which has square game tiles across all screen sizes I used vmin values. I found information on vmin and vmax values in [this article](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-viewport-units-quick-)


#### Local Storage Credit
- When establishing a method by which game scores could be stored to local memory, I found information on passing values as JSON data at the following pages:
  1. [outline of JSON methods](https://m204wiki.rocketsoftware.com/index.php/List_of_Json_methods)
  1. [use of .stringify method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3357553/how-do-i-store-an-array-in-localstorage)

#### Comparison Function
- A comparison function discovered in this [stack oveflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1129216/sort-array-of-objects-by-string-property-value)
is used to sort user game scores, so they can be listed in ascending order at the [leaderboard.html page](https://nickassafkirk.github.io/Memory_Minder_Memory_Game/leaderboard.html)
- **Original code** `function compare( a, b ) {
  if ( a.last_nom < b.last_nom ){
    return -1;
  }
  if ( a.last_nom > b.last_nom ){
    return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
objs.sort( compare );`
